This project was a personal initiative to predict house prices using the publicly available Kaggle dataset. It was designed to showcase my skills in machine learning, featuring extensive data analysis, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and the application of a stacking ensemble model to enhance prediction accuracy.
